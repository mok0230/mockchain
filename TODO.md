# TODO

- Create miner node server
- First miner (defined as having no peers) mines genesis block
- Other miners add peers using command line argument on instantiation
- Then ping all peers to get longest blockchain
- Then start mining
- Adjust difficulty every 10 seconds (or different amount of time if it makes sense)
- Add ability to send a transaction via CLI
- Add ability to view blockchain via CLI

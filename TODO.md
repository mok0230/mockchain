# TODO

- First miner (defined as having no peers) mines genesis block
- Other miners add peers using command line argument on instantiation
- Then ping all peers to get longest blockchain
- Then start mining
- Create logger Node.js process
- Build basic UI
- Get hash rates from logger (?) - endpoint TBD
- Adjust difficulty every 10 seconds (or different amount of time if it makes sense)
- Add ability to execute a transaction in the UI
